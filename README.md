# BottomNavigationBar
Simple Bottom Navigation Bar for Android.

## TODO
1) Finish stuff

2) Describe lib

3) Make gif

## Why is it better than library X?
1) Tabs without titles are supported

2) Properly displayed in layout editor

3) Simple layout, no nested containers

4) Simple API and code

5) Smooth native animations, no alpha or requestLayout() calls

6) It's tiny. Literally ~10 times smaller than some average bottom bar lib

## Why is it worse than library X?
1) There's only a single behavior - fixed tabs. No shifting mode, no dynamic color change of bottom bar

2) No special tablet mode

3) No badges with counters
